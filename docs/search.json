Her research has involved the empirical process, high-dimensional modeling, and, more recently, technology in education and reproducible research. Sara Stoudt is an applied statistician whose work primarily focuses on environmental and ecological applications. She is currently an assistant professor at Bucknell University. She received her PhD in Statistics from UC Berkeley. Prior to that she received a B.A. in Mathematics (with an emphasis on statistics) from Smith College.\nLink to the book\nNolan Website\nStoudt Website\n\n\n\n",

This increased detection rate matters because those with false negative results (HIV-positive individuals whose disease goes undetected by a test) are likely not to return for further testing. The specificity of the rapid test is 97%. For example in a population of 692,000 with 12,000 HIV-positive, we expect \\((0.83*12,000 =) 9,960\\) HIV-positive people to test positive and \\(((1-0.97)*(692,000 - 12,000) =) 20,400\\) HIV-negative people to test positive. That is, the test has a precision of only \\((9,960/(20,400+9,960) =) 32.8\\%\\). However the rapid test can be immediately administered a second time for anyone with a positive result. With this two-step approach the precision increases to \\(((12,000/69,2000*0.83^2)/((12,000/69,2000*0.83^2) + (680,000/692,000*0.03^2)) =) 93.1\\%\\).\n\n\n\n",
